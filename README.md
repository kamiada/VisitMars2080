# Visit Mars 2080 (if we are still going to be alive)

The purpose of this project is to
1. Design responsive, pleasant for the eyes website which follows all required UX/UI rules
2. Use modern React methods - context, refs, hooks. 
3. Have this website in three different languages Polish (my native language), English (my everyday language) and French (which I am still learning)

## Scripts (for my sake mostly)
`yarn start`
`yarn test`
`yarn build`
`yarn eject`
